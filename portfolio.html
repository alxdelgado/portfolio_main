            <p>Hey, welcome to my page! Here you will find the projects I've been working on while attending General Assembly's WDI program. It has been an intense few months and I have learned so much. While working in agile methodology all of our projects have been completed in one week sprints from concept to deployment. While the task was challenging, it was extremely rewarding to see our concepts take shape and be out in the world for people to see. I hope you enjoy them as much as I do!</p><br/>
